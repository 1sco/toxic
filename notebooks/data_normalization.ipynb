In this lecture Mangcu takes issue with what he sees as the discussions of \"\"populism\"\" that caricature its meanings and history as simply a rhetorical stance or politics of popular grievance against elites. He developed this argument in his weekly column in Business Day December 7, 2007, drawing on Gianna Pomata's scholarship on the history of populism in Europe  and her treatment of populist critics as part of an intellectual tradition of \"\"Enlightenment rationalism\"\" and growing separation of of popular and elite intellectual cultures. He also makes  a number of parallels with South African journalists and scholars whom he believes treat populism in very superficial ways. . Mangcu also develops these arguments in his forthcoming book, To the Brink (Universityof Kwa Xulu Natal, 2008), sure to create a major discussion in African academic and intellectual circles since he is widely described as the main intellectual heir to Steve Biko, the founder of the Black Consciousness Movement. FOr an excerpt of his forthcoming book see http://book.co.za/bookchat/topic.php?id=2079\\n\\nAs far as Mike Huckabee's \"\"populism\"\" is concerned, the piece by David Kirkpatrick in the New York Times January 13, 2008 (\"\"Young Evangelicals Embrace Huckabee\"\") has a detailed discussion of why many Catholics and evangelicals see him as populist. The article, among many in the American election season, is shows the strikingly difference valence of populism in the US and Europe. In the US the term, on balance, clearly has positive associations  otherwise major candidates like Edwards and Huckabee would not use it in self-description. This is  a product, most likely, of the much greater public awareness of the history of democratic movements like the 19th century farmers' cooperatives, New Deal reform, and the black freedom strucggle as broadly populist.

Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia of general knowledge rather than an index of profiles of companies and people. Each article needs several independent reliable sources to show significant impact on the historical record. The guidance for organizations is given at WP:ORG and for biographies WP:BIO applies.\\n\\nIf the articles you are creating have reliable sources to support the criteria defined in that guidance then you may have a reason to keep the articles from being deleted which you are welcome to raise on the article talk page or on any linked deletion discussion. If you are associated with the organization, person or product the article is about then you must follow the conflict of interest guidelines and avoid editing the article yourself but you are free to suggest and discuss changes.\\n\\nRather than starting \"\"live\"\" articles, you can create a draft first which allows you to get your article properly sourced before risking speedy deletion - see Userspace draft and Userfication.\\n\\nIf you would like some independent help you can ask one of the noticeboards at WP:Requests or try chatting with other Wikipedians on .\\n\\nThanks,   \"</td>\n",

This (Israeli?) misinformation has been repeated in news media and on this site. It is completely untrue.

I could well be wrong: I'm willing to be put right.\\n\\nIn saying that the prose was OK but not great, I was thinking precisely of WP:WIAGA which requires of a Good Article that \"\"the prose is clear and the spelling and grammar are correct.\"\"  This is a lesser hurdle than the \"\"professional\"\" quality required of an FA.  To say this is not a criticism of GA.\\n\\nNow, again, I could well be wrong with my understanding of the current standards at GA.  I have done plenty of GA reviews in my time, but not recently.  This is why I pinged Geometryguy, an uninvolved editor who has great experience with GA, whose views I respect enormously.  More generally, the point of GAR is to seek comments from the broader community.\\n\\nAgain, if I (or anyone else) wanted to ride roughshod over the GA process, we'd simply have reviewed the article and passed it forthwith.  But no: my purpose in putting the article up for GAR was to defuse the conflict, and get a broader spectrum of views.\\n\\nThe purpose was also to separate out the question of the article review from the issue of the block.

Indeed one only has to search 'Kate Kennedy Club' in either Google Books or simply Google to see the number of accounts of the club's purpose and aims in published books, national newspapers and online. I would be more than happy to list the names of the books/ the links to the articles in national press which reference the club, if that is necessary?

       "90707   Perhaps if this information was on Wikipedia you wouldn't be so incorrect. I've had a single recently place on top 100 billboard breakout artist. That song is currently getting college airplay on a national level through universal records marketing. I have my own label (assuming that page would get deleted) which is promotion marketing and distribution. I will never sign to a major label. Not that I can't I've been songwriting in the industry over five years and have credits with Atlantic records. Do you want me to screenshot royalty checks? My article was not complete as I did not submit all vital information. I plan on releasing my album and another single with help from universal records in which I am aiming higher. How can I become more notable in your eyes to permit my wiki? When will I be valid to you?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "86009   \"\\n\\npopulism as a positive term, and a critique of critics\\n\\nSince I wrote last fall, several notable developments in the scholarship and discussion of populism have occurred. The South African intellectual and scholar Xolela Mangcu has entered the global discussion, building on a highly visible lecture he gave in Cape Town for the Wolpe Trust last June 18, \"\"Jacob Zuma on the Politics of Grievance\"\" (http://www.wolpetrust.org.za/dialogue2007/mangcupaper.pdf ). In this lecture Mangcu takes issue with what he sees as the discussions of \"\"populism\"\" that caricature its meanings and history as simply a rhetorical stance or politics of popular grievance against elites. He developed this argument in his weekly column in Business Day December 7, 2007, drawing on Gianna Pomata's scholarship on the history of populism in Europe  and her treatment of populist critics as part of an intellectual tradition of \"\"Enlightenment rationalism\"\" and growing separation of of popular and elite intellectual cultures. He also makes  a number of parallels with South African journalists and scholars whom he believes treat populism in very superficial ways. . Mangcu also develops these arguments in his forthcoming book, To the Brink (Universityof Kwa Xulu Natal, 2008), sure to create a major discussion in African academic and intellectual circles since he is widely described as the main intellectual heir to Steve Biko, the founder of the Black Consciousness Movement. FOr an excerpt of his forthcoming book see http://book.co.za/bookchat/topic.php?id=2079\\n\\nAs far as Mike Huckabee's \"\"populism\"\" is concerned, the piece by David Kirkpatrick in the New York Times January 13, 2008 (\"\"Young Evangelicals Embrace Huckabee\"\") has a detailed discussion of why many Catholics and evangelicals see him as populist. The article, among many in the American election season, is shows the strikingly difference valence of populism in the US and Europe. In the US the term, on balance, clearly has positive associations  otherwise major candidates like Edwards and Huckabee would not use it in self-description. This is  a product, most likely, of the much greater public awareness of the history of democratic movements like the 19th century farmers' cooperatives, New Deal reform, and the black freedom strucggle as broadly populist.

       "1704    Yes you're right, theologically Catholicism is very different to American protestantism which gave birth to the creationist movement and are certainly not interested in the sort of fundamentalist theocracy that most of them want.  Sure, they use the teleological argument, but phrase it in theological language which is a lot different from scientific language and hence it isn't pseudoscience, which is what irks me as a scientist.  But I don't understand theology (probably because I've been trained to think too scientifically).  And the Catholic Church most of the time has better things to do than make statements on scientific issues.  But Catholics are really into authority, so what the hierarchy says, goes. — Dunc|☺                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

This is definitely NOT the experience I had so far with other users here on Wikipedia, some of them with a lot better claim at being right than him. I put the image and at he books they were scanned issue up for review at the project page, so we can have consensus. Your view will stand on it's merits and so will mine.

Even if it's time-consuming, it is probably better than edit-warring and long talk-page arguments.

       "110252  \"\\nGuidance on notability\\nHi Ayo Oshunremi,\\n\\nWikipedia has its own guidance for notability that may not be the same as your intuitive sense of what is notable. Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia of general knowledge rather than an index of profiles of companies and people. Each article needs several independent reliable sources to show significant impact on the historical record. The guidance for organizations is given at WP:ORG and for biographies WP:BIO applies.\\n\\nIf the articles you are creating have reliable sources to support the criteria defined in that guidance then you may have a reason to keep the articles from being deleted which you are welcome to raise on the article talk page or on any linked deletion discussion. If you are associated with the organization, person or product the article is about then you must follow the conflict of interest guidelines and avoid editing the article yourself but you are free to suggest and discuss changes.\\n\\nRather than starting \"\"live\"\" articles, you can create a draft first which allows you to get your article properly sourced before risking speedy deletion - see Userspace draft and Userfication.\\n\\nIf you would like some independent help you can ask one of the noticeboards at WP:Requests or try chatting with other Wikipedians on .\\n\\nThanks,   \"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "78899   I strongly disagree that the City of Largo photo is unacceptable; but I do agree that also having a photo as Susan is necessary. Since starting this article backwhen, I occasionally check in; the edit history with the photo has been that for a time there was a photo as Susan (though editors at the time still kept the caption claiming it was the official City of Largo photo, which it wasn't). Unfortunately, the photo provided was a copyvio from a photo session Susan did with I believe the St. Petersburg times. I would recommend that if anyone has an email or whatever with Susan, that they contact her & see if she might herself be willing to provide a current photo. I'm betting she'd be willing, given her apparent commitment to using her experience positively, towards educating the public about trans issues.\\nMeanwhile, I support removing the City of Largo official photo from the bio infobox & having it only further down in the article.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "56692   \"\\n\\nEvents don't need titles?\\nThere is a common pratice by American television to label events as if it were a television programme.

Is it subtle POV to have to label every event with a title.\\n\\nWho called this \"\"2007 Algiers bombings\"\"?  Obviously we have to use words.

       "120626  Yep, only 12 so far.  This (albeit 2005)  says 13 complete beakers (review near bottom of page); the 2009 Wedepohl and Kronz article states 14 so I wonder where the 14th came from between 2005 and 2009.  Or if 13 is simply a typo?  Or 14, for that matter?\\n\\nIt would be great if we could get someone at the BM to photograph their example, and if we could eventually illustrate all the complete examples in a sort of 'compare and contratst' exercise. 81.147.148.65                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "63151   I won't fight the block as it's well deserved, but it would be nice if someone would attempt to prevent Soosim from tampering with the Paul Murphy info. He's been modifying the context of that statement in order to support the idea (false?) presented above that the convoy's main focus is bringing bulk food to Gaza, rather than things like medical supplies. This (Israeli?) misinformation has been repeated in news media and on this site. It is completely untrue. I know you don't have much reason to by sypmathetic with me due to my anti-Semetic trolling (*I* thought it was funny....) but my edits, with the exception of one where I was unaware of policy and had never heard of the guy (Howard Jacobson delete attempt), are in keeping with the spirit of wiki. The sentence Soosim keeps removing is accurate and has been properly sourced.

       "129173  \"\\n\\nMattisse, please believe me that I had no intention of pre-determining the outcome of the GAR.  As I said, I hadn't even read the article with any great attention when I put it up for GAR.  I then read it, and said that in my view it passed.  I could well be wrong: I'm willing to be put right.\\n\\nIn saying that the prose was OK but not great, I was thinking precisely of WP:WIAGA which requires of a Good Article that \"\"the prose is clear and the spelling and grammar are correct.\"\"  This is a lesser hurdle than the \"\"professional\"\" quality required of an FA.  To say this is not a criticism of GA.\\n\\nNow, again, I could well be wrong with my understanding of the current standards at GA.  I have done plenty of GA reviews in my time, but not recently.  This is why I pinged Geometryguy, an uninvolved editor who has great experience with GA, whose views I respect enormously.  More generally, the point of GAR is to seek comments from the broader community.\\n\\nAgain, if I (or anyone else) wanted to ride roughshod over the GA process, we'd simply have reviewed the article and passed it forthwith.  But no: my purpose in putting the article up for GAR was to defuse the conflict, and get a broader spectrum of views.\\n\\nThe purpose was also to separate out the question of the article review from the issue of the block.  At GAR, we're judging the article, not the editor (or even the reviewer).\\n\\nI'm sorry if for you this experience has been \"\"horrible.\"\"  I certainly have had no intention to \"\"attack\"\" or \"\"bully\"\" you, and indeed have not attacked or bullied you.

       "2  Hey man, I'm really not trying to edit war. It's just that this guy is constantly removing relevant information and talking to me through edits instead of my talk page. He seems to care more about the formatting than the actual info.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
